# Ski with me

## What is the goal?

I want to go skiing but most of my friends who ski are in Romania.

It would be great if I there would be a directory where I look up skies/snowboarders who go to/live close to a specific resort and message them to pair up for a few ski days.

> **Main goal:** connect more advance skiers/snowboarders with each other soe they can go ski together.  


## How to install it and get started  


```
git clone https://github.com/stefi23/ski-with-me
$ cd ski-with-me
$ npm run migrate  
$ npm start
```

Open another terminal window:
```
$ cd ski-with-me
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

## When? (Situation)

When you want to go skiing/snowboarding in a specific place but none of your friends cand join you or you are new in a town with no skier/boarder friends and would like some company.

You then go to this database and look for buddies. In a way it's an app for ski/snowboard hangouts.

## So I can? (Expected outcome)

Fomd someone or more people to go skiing/snowboarding with.
